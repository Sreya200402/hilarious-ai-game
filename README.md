# 🤣 Hilarious AI Game

A fun and interactive **Python CLI** that responds with sarcastic punchlines and jokes based on what you type!

---

## 🎯 About

**Hilarious AI Game** is a lightweight Python program that playfully interacts with you.  
It detects topics such as **coding**, **movies**, **life**, **fun**, or **special** and returns witty, sarcastic responses.

The program uses simple keyword detection, random joke generation, and even remembers your last message for callbacks — making every run feel dynamic!

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Topic detection** (`coding`, `movies`, `life`, `fun`, `special`)
- 😂 **100+ random jokes** dynamically filled with your input
- 💬 **Conversation memory** for follow-up humor
- 🐍 **Pure Python** — no extra libraries required

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python **3.7+** (recommended: 3.8 or newer)  
- Works on **Windows**, **macOS**, or **Linux**  
- No external dependencies — only `random` and `time` from Python’s standard library

---

## ▶️ How to Run

Open a terminal in the folder containing your file  
(e.g., `E:\python_programs\game(import).py`) and run:

```bash
# On Windows (PowerShell or CMD)
python "game(import).py"

# On macOS / Linux
python3 'game(import).py'

💡 **Tip:** Because your filename has parentheses, always use quotes around it when running on Windows.


```

## 🕹️ **Example Run (Preview)**

**Here’s a sample session of what your terminal might look like when running the game:**
Welcome to **Ultimate Hilarious AI Punches** 🤣  
Talk about coding, movies, life, fun, or anything!  
Type 'quit' to exit.  

You: python loops  
AI: 'python loops'? Your loops are scarier than Tollywood horror 😱 🤣  

You: car drift  
AI: Car drift? Did physics quit on you? 🚗😵 🤪  

You: love life  
AI: 'love life'? Even aliens are laughing 👽🤣  

You: quit  
AI: Finally… some peace 😏👋

🎉 **That’s it! Every time you run the program, you’ll get unique, sarcastic, AI-powered punchlines.**
